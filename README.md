Marketing expenses statistics
Marketing department wants to know:

How people use the product
When they start to buy
How much money each customer brings
When they pay off
The purpose of the work is profit, which source of income is unprofitable, and which income. The method is court analysis. Concentrations will be calculated in the project, product metrics will also be distributed.

The work consists of:
→ Data preprocessing
→ DAU, WAU and MAU calculation
→ Retention Rate calculation
→ Custom Metrics
→ LTV calculation
→ САС, ROMI


There were no repetitions in the original data, but the temporal data were outside the scope of the study. But each user could make several sessions. The marketing spend data is missing information on several traffic sources. The analysis was carried out without them. Connectivity devices—PC and mobile—are unevenly separated. PC has an advantage => you need to make an adaptive layout for mobile devices.

Sources bring traffic in different ways: number 1, 2 and 5 are in the lead.

User growth depends on holidays and weekends. Illustrates the fall on December 31, 2017. On this day, you can lower your bids in advertising systems to minus 100. Since August 2017, there has been an increase in both weekly and monthly growth.

Custom Metrics The average is 1 session per day, considering cohorts. If for all - 4.5 times. The weighted average session length is half a minute.

Retention August and September 2018 cohorts show the best result Average cohort lifespan: 197 days, maximum 365.

Audience warm-up For six months, on average, they buy 14 times. Ponder 2 months on average. 75% buy within an hour.

Expertise needed Of interest is the September 2017 cohort. It is necessary to find data on users and conduct a targeted analysis of the cohort and the conditions of their purchasing power. Highest LTV!

Average check We observe a jump and growth after September 2017, the peak value is in December 2017 (sale?), a natural fall in the 1st quarter of the year, a gradual decline and leveling off from April 2018 Averages 0.09 c.u.

Trends of the second month The growth of purchases from the second month was especially shown by the cohort “201802”, collected in February 2018. Then the fall and stabilization since April 2018

LTV Preliminary conclusion. LTV is good for 1,2,5 traffic sources. Average LTV - 8 c.u. Sources: In terms of profitability and LTV, 1,2 and 5 are the most productive. The third source is the most costly.

According to the ROMI metric (the ratio of marketing injections and income), ranking of sources: 1st source 9th source 2nd source 5th source 4th source Closes the 3rd traffic source The third source is the most used and the most costly. The fourth one shows a consistently high ROMI, even if we only visualize the changes (on the chart, the difference from the previous month)

Without data on missing traffic sources, it is impossible to draw full conclusions.
